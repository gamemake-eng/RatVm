#   RATVM: A simple VM made by a rat

This is a C rewrite of a ISA that I first wrote in javascript for the [VecBoy](https://github.com/gamemake-eng/VecBoy) Fantasy console. I designed it so that it can be added to any project just by copying the directory and adding the files to your project.

##  Features

-   16-BIT

-   2 256 byte working stacks

-   256 levels of nested subroutines

-   ~65kb max ram

-   *new* 256 serial lines

##  What's next

I am hoping to be able to use this as a base for future fantasy consoles that I can have one underlining platform for. I am also planning to make a forth like language for the ISA to make development easier (because simple rat asm can be hard to work with).

Thanks r100 for creating uxn which was the inspiration for RatVm
